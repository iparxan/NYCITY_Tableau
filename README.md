## Overview of the statistical analysis:
Thus, data will explain the bike user checkout time by weekdays and hours and examine whether there is a gender difference. Show three points 
Show the length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and different genders per hour and per day.
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### Results:
We had a story about over examine questions:
Section 1 will explain the overall trip time by User a day and overall trip time by gender distribution. Looking at the graph, a trip duration of less than one hour is a typical pattern, and there are substantial gender differences in which more males use bikes than females.
Section 2 compares overall bike-trip time in terms of weekday and per hour. There are significant differences in "rush" hours on the weekday, and rush hours include the before work time and after a work time. People use bikes during "rush hours." In addition, we also see the weekends when people use bikes for the trip or random biking.
Section 3 tells us whether the trip time has gender differences. It seems again males use much more bikes than females and others. The dark orange color indicated heavy users. Males bikers' pattern of using bikes based on the trip time is the same as the overall pattern. Others also have a similar pattern. females did not show a similar pattern
Section 4 tells us why gender does matter in this data. We can see the Dashboard where we put several pieces of data. We provided the gender counts of bike users. There are lots of biker users in, male than female. In addition, In terms of costumer and subscriber by gender and weekday categorization, the male subscriber is much more than females and males. It seems that male users are more active in using bikes than females and others. 

Section 4 also shows the Bike reparis and Bike utilization for all users. In these two graph Data presents the BikeID  for repairs and trip time. 
Last section in a story shows the relationship between the trip duration of bike users versus age . Average trip duration versus age layeout and teh results shows that tehre are two big outlier one is the bike user born 1890s and another is bike user who born 1970. Probably tehse tow type Bike is mor convienient without car being popular in 1890s and big deression in 1970s. However teh data can't tell these points.

### Summary: 
Bike user trip duration had gender differences and bike user use bike most ly less an hour in daily usage. People use bike rush hours more frequently than the other time during the day. Future we should add usage of car since year by year people use car than bike in their work especially when we checking of relationship between bike trip duration with age.

Bike used for short distance or short trip such as less than one hour.
